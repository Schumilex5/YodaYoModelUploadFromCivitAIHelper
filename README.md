Hi. This was made for personal use, it may have bugs I don't know about, but it works for me and does the things i want, if you meet errors you can let me know but I don't promise I'll fix them.

### Features:
- Auto translation to english
- Copy title, category, trigger words, description from CivitAI to YodaYo with 2 clicks

### Installation:
* Download the extension folder
* Go to -> chrome://extensions/
* Click "Load unpacked extension"
* Navigate inside the extension folder when asked for location

### Usage:
- Click the extension icon when on a civitai model page and "Copy from civitai"
- Go switch over to your yodayo upload page and click paste to yodayo

## Known Bugs:
- If every prompt group is a single word it will create a new tag group for each word on yodayo page 2
- Fails to filter out "Trigger word" stuff from description, sometimes you have to edit the description yourslef after model upload to make it look better
